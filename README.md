## TODO:
1. add a trash icon to each node so users can delete a node
   - i might want to add an "edit" button at the top so we only show the trash icon if the edit button is clicked
2. Come up with the graph algorithm so that only when all nodes that point to it are complete do we mark it to be worked on
3. move the code in app.tsx to it's own component so I can reuse it
4. in app add the ability create new tabs and add a "New Project +" button
   - when user clicks new project, it should add a new tab
5. Add a Hadrian Logo a the top


- show toast if user completes all tasks
